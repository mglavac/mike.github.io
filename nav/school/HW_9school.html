<p><h2>This is my second time going to college.  I had been bouncing around different industries and have been finding it difficult to move up without a bachelors degree.  I had found a liking of marketing while working as a brand rep for a liquor broker in Chicago.  I emailed many local schools and Emily Cronaur was the most enthusiastic about meeting with me.  Every other school gave negative responses.  I met Emily 4 years ago and in a few weeks I will be graduating with my B.S. in Marketing with a certificate in interactive marketing.  Below I have detailed some of my journey over the last few years.</h2></p>

I needed to take a few prerequisites as well as a few classes to enter the NIU College of Business.  In total I took 12 classes at JJC and received 9 A's and 3 B's.  This helped me attain an NIU Transfer Scholorship.</p>

I took the dreaded UBUS 310 9 credit hour lecture course.  I worked hard and recieved a B+ missing an A- by .1 percentage points.  I have maintained a GPA above 3.5 in my time at NIU.  This accomplishment granted me an invatation into the NIU Marketing Honors Society.  I also received the Michael T. McSweeney Endowed Direct Marketing Award as well as the Target American Marketing Society Award.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.niuama.com/"><img src="AMA.png" width="180" height="90" align="right"  alt="American Marketing Association Logo" /></a>In my time at NIU I have been an active member of the NIU chapter of the American Marketing Association.  In my second semester I became a Director of Fundraising and helped raise over $1500 for the organization.  I was elected president for the 2016-17 school year.  It has been a really tough year for the AMA.  The chapter had been in decline because of mismanagment and a lack of organization.  I spent a large part of this year restructuring the group so they will be successful moving forward.  It hurts a little knowing I will not enjoy in their future success but I can say I am big reason why they are successful.  Click the AMA logo for our chapter webpage</p>
