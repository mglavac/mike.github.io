<p><img src="BreckMe.jpg" width="240" height="360" align="right" border="4 alt="Picture of me at Breckenridge" />Thank you for visiting my webpage.  I will be demonstrating many of the html skills I have learned over the course of this semester.  I set the page up using frames and linking all pages into frame 3 which I have named "content".  The "nav" frame is used to hold all the links to the different pages.  For me, the use of a frame built webpage feels a lot smoother and looks more professional.  I have enjoyed the clas and I hope you enjoy my webpage.</p>
